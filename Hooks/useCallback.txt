🎣 useCallback is a hook in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 Its main purpose is to optimize performance by memoizing (caching) callback functions.

🎭 Use of useCallback

When we have a component that renders frequently or has children components that rely on callback functions as props, using useCallback can help prevent unnecessary re-creation of those functions on each render.
