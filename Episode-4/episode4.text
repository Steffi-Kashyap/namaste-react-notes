Episode 4: Talk is cheap, show me the code, I learned about props, different ways to pass the data through props, config driven UI.

â—¾ Props:- When we have dynamic passing some data to a component, we pass in as a prop. props are used to share the data from parent-to-child components. Also, props allow us to create reusable and modular components by providing a way to customize their behavior and appearance.

â—¾ Ways to pass props:- There are two ways to pass the props 
1) Normal Way 
2) Destructuring way

â—¾ Config driven UI:- It is basically controlling our UI, how the UI looks like using data config and that config comes from the backend.

ðŸš€ Superpower of config-driven UI:-

â—¦ Flexibility
â—¦ Customization and Personalization
â—¦ Reduced Development Time



1) Normal Way:-

const Header = (props) => {
  return(
    <div>
    <h3>{props.resName}</h3>
    </div>
  )
}

const Body = () => {
  return(
   <div>
   <res resName="Namste React" />
   </div>
    
  )
}



2) Destructuring way

// ParentComponent.jsx


const Heading = () => {
  const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Child {...person} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Heading;
